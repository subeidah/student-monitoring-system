------------------------------Student Monitoring system------------------------------

Task:
This Project is creating student Monitoring system that can be used by teachers/lecturers to monitor students performance. By identifying students that are at risk of failing, they can be offered additional support. This tool can also be used to keep track of performance overall such as assessing average scores etc. 

A python program has been written in Database_creation.ipynb file to create an sql database that stores cleaned, transformed data from the Test Results folder containing raw csv files of customer data.
